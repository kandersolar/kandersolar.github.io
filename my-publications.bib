  abstract={The Lake of the Clouds, located inside the Porcupine Mountains and two miles away from Lake Superior, is a famous vista site within the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, Michigan. Even though several fishery surveys of the lake were released by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the 1940s, no known algal studies have been conducted. The Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park has experienced a relatively low level of anthropogenic disturbance compared to other regions of the Great Lakes, which makes it an appealing site for algal studies. This paper reports the exploratory research   done  by professorsand students at the University of Michigan Biological Station on the algal diversity of the Lake of the Clouds. Water chemistry shows this lake to be slightly acidic and with low nutrients and low conductivity. In this study, fresh samples of algae and cleaned diatom samples were investigated. From the living algal samples, 7 algal divisions were observed. The inventory showed that, based on the number of genera recorded, the Chlorophyta is more diverse than other algal divisions. A total of 78 genera (excluding diatoms) and 29 species of algae were identified from the living samples. Nearly 150 species in 58 genera   of diatoms (Bacillariophyta) were also recorded from the cleaned samples. Among the diatoms, three species new to science were identified and are described here. These are Brachysira ontonageniana Kociolek & Lowe, B.  gatesii Kociolek & Lowe, and Gomphonema porcupiniana Kociolek & Lowe. This rich list of algal taxa is only the first step in exploring the algal diversity, microhabitats, and ecosystem of the Lake of the Clouds. The  diversity of algal taxa found in this study suggests that further algal research on the Lake of the Clouds is warranted.},

	abstract = {The problem of estimating non-resonant astrophysical S-factors and thermonuclear reaction rates, based on measured nuclear cross sections, is of major interest for nuclear energy generation, neutrino physics, and element synthesis. Many different methods have been applied to this problem in the past, almost all of them based on traditional statistics. Bayesian methods, on the other hand, are now in widespread use in the physical sciences. In astronomy, for example, Bayesian statistics is applied to the observation of extrasolar planets, gravitational waves, and Type Ia supernovae. However, nuclear physics, in particular, has been slow to adopt Bayesian methods. We present astrophysical S-factors and reaction rates based on Bayesian statistics. We develop a framework that incorporates robust parameter estimation, systematic effects, and non-Gaussian uncertainties in a consistent manner. The method is applied to the reactions d(p,γ)3He, 3He(3He,2p)4He, and 3He(α,γ)7Be, important for deuterium burning, solar neutrinos, and Big Bang nucleosynthesis.},

In this work, the effect of different geometries and materials of torque tubes is evaluated through ray-trace simulations and found to cause rear irradiance shading factors between 2% to 8% for systems without gap between the modules in 2-UP configuration. Inclusion of a gap between the modules can offset the shading factor. Electrical mismatch is also evaluated for the various configurations, and a methodology to apply shading factor and electrical mismatch loss to rear irradiance from the calculated loss in DC power, which averages 1% for the systems explored here, is proposed.},

  abstract={ Many tracking PV systems avoid row-to-row shading by backtracking in morning and afternoon.  Because the common single-axis backtracking implementation assumes the array is in a horizontal plane, it does not fully prevent row-to-row shading in arrays installed on cross-axis slopes.  This paper simulates the effect of reduced self-shading on annual production with two modified backtracking strategies.  Depending on the array geometry and the steepness of the cross-axis grade, using a modified backtracking strategy improved annual yield by 3-10%.},

  year={2020},
  doi={10.1109/PVSC45281.2020.9300750},
  abstract={ Photovoltaic system production simulations are conventionally run using hourly weather datasets.  Hourly simulations are sufficiently accurate to predict the majority of long-term system behavior but cannot resolve high-frequency effects like inverter clipping caused by short-duration irradiance variability.  Direct modeling of this subhourly clipping error is only possible for the few locations with high-resolution irradiance datasets.  This paper describes a method of predicting the magnitude of this error using a machine learning model and 30-minute satellite irradiance data.  The method predicts a correction for each 30-minute interval with the potential to roll up into 60-minute corrections to match an hourly energy model.  The model is trained and validated at locations where the error can be directly simulated from 1-minute ground data.  The validation shows low bias at most ground station locations.  The model is also applied to gridded satellite irradiance to produce a heatmap of the estimated clipping error across the United States.  Finally, the relative importance of each predictor satellite variable is retrieved from the model and discussed.},

  abstract={ This paper presents two methods of detecting inverter downtime and estimating lost production from downtime events using timeseries system power measurements. The methods focus on distinguishing communications interruptions from true production outages and are successful in most cases. To enable fleet-scale analysis of inverter availability, the methods are designed to be semi-autonomous. The first method uses only inverter and system meter AC power measurements while the second uses cumulative production and expected energy data to classify outages and estimate lost production. The methods are demonstrated using real field data and the results are discussed.},

  abstract={ Data for thousands of systems by multiple sources were transmitted to NREL for evaluation. Initial automated data quality assurance (QA) checks identified hundreds of systems (QA Tier 1) with high-quality meteorological and AC production data and hundreds of QA Tier 2 systems with adequate data quality. A standard RdTools analysis was conducted for these systems, evaluating performance loss on an annualized basis. To date with the systems evaluated so far, we find a median performance loss rate (aka Rd or degradation rates) for the entire fleet of -0.72%/year based on individual inverter data, which is in line with historical degradation rates previously published for modules and systems (-0.5% to -0.9% / yr, Jordan et al. 2016). A fleet-scale distribution based on revenue-grade meter data rather than inverter AC (alternating current) data yields a slightly different result. We are working to understand the difference between this result and the inverter-based result of -0.72%/year.},
